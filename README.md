# 🎯 Kinematics of Bouncy Ball Toy Project

A physics-based simulation of a bouncing ball interacting with air .

## 📚 Concepts Implemented

- Gravity (g = 980 px/s²)
- Kinematic equations:
  - v = u + at
  - s = vt
- Energy loss (restitution)


## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- requestAnimationFrame physics loop

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Quadratic drag force
- Angular momentum
- 2D collision engine
- Wave equation simulation

---

Built as a physics visualization project.
